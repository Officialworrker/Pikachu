In "Blooming Utopia," you play as a magical gardener with the power to cultivate special flowers that transform the world. Each flower you grow has the ability to heal the hearts of criminals, turning them into angels and guiding them towards a path of kindness. Your ultimate goal is to convert the entire world into a peaceful utopia.

**Gameplay:**

1. **Garden Building:** Start with a small, barren garden and gradually expand it by planting different types of magical flowers. Each type of flower has unique effects, such as calming anger, promoting empathy, or inspiring creativity.

2. **Healing the World:** As you grow more flowers, the game world around your garden changes. You’ll see criminals start to repent and change their ways, turning into angels who spread positive energy. The more flowers you grow, the more people you convert, and the larger your influence on the world becomes.

5. **Endgame:** The ultimate challenge is to convert the entire world. As you get closer to this goal, you face tougher challenges, such as resisting the spread of corruption or saving those who have strayed too far into darkness. The game culminates in the final transformation of Earth into a utopian world, where harmony and peace reign supreme.

**Visuals & Art Style:**
The game features a bright, colorful art style, with each flower and area bursting with vibrant colors as they transform. The shift from darkness to light will be visually dramatic, emphasizing the impact of your gardening efforts.
